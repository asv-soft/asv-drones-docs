### Recommendations for Preventing Damages

#### Introduction

Asv.Drones prioritizes the safe and responsible operation of drones. To minimize the risk of damages to the drone, property, and the surrounding environment, consider the following recommendations when planning and executing drone operations.

#### 1. **Thorough Pre-Flight Check:**

   - **Inspect the Drone:**
     - *Recommendation:* Before each flight, conduct a comprehensive pre-flight check. Inspect the drone for any visible damage, loose components, or signs of wear.

   - **Check Propellers:**
     - *Recommendation:* Examine propellers for damage, deformation, or obstructions. Ensure they are securely attached and rotate freely.

#### 2. **Environmental Awareness:**

   - **Avoid Obstacles:**
     - *Recommendation:* Be mindful of obstacles and structures in the flight path. Plan flight paths that avoid trees, buildings, and other potential hazards.

   - **Check Weather Conditions:**
     - *Recommendation:* Check weather conditions before each flight. Avoid flying in adverse weather, such as strong winds, rain, or low visibility.

#### 3. **Safe Takeoff and Landing:**

   - **Level Ground for Takeoff:**
     - *Recommendation:* Select a flat and level surface for takeoff to prevent the drone from tilting during launch.

   - **Land in Safe Areas:**
     - *Recommendation:* Choose safe landing areas away from potential hazards. Avoid uneven terrain or areas with tall grass that may obstruct the landing.

#### 4. **Maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS):**

   - **Keep the Drone in Sight:**
     - *Recommendation:* Always maintain visual line of sight with the drone. This helps prevent collisions and allows for better control and awareness of the surroundings.

   - **Utilize Visual Aids:**
     - *Recommendation:* Use visual aids, such as bright propeller colors or LED lights, to enhance visibility, especially during low-light conditions.

#### 5. **Battery Management:**

   - **Monitor Battery Levels:**
     - *Recommendation:* Keep a close eye on battery levels during flight. Plan missions to ensure the drone can return home or land safely before the battery becomes critically low.

   - **Avoid Deep Discharges:**
     - *Recommendation:* Avoid deep discharges of the battery. Land the drone when battery levels reach a safe threshold to prolong battery life.

#### 6. **Emergency Preparedness:**

   - **Know Emergency Procedures:**
     - *Recommendation:* Familiarize yourself with emergency procedures, including Return to Home (RTH) functions and manual control overrides.

   - **Practice Emergency Drills:**
     - *Recommendation:* Conduct simulated emergency drills to practice responding to critical situations. This enhances operator readiness.

#### 7. **Operational Boundaries:**

   - **Respect Altitude Limits:**
     - *Recommendation:* Adhere to altitude limits specified by regulations and drone capabilities. This prevents potential collisions with obstacles or other aircraft.

   - **Avoid Flyaways:**
     - *Recommendation:* Be cautious of flyaway situations. Ensure proper GPS signal and take preventive measures, such as setting a safe home point.

#### 8. **Post-Flight Maintenance:**

   - **Inspect After Each Flight:**
     - *Recommendation:* After each flight, inspect the drone for any damages, loose parts, or abnormal wear. Address issues promptly.

   - **Clean and Protect:**
     - *Recommendation:* Clean the drone and components after flying in dusty or dirty environments. Consider using protective cases during transport.

#### Conclusion

By following these recommendations, drone operators can significantly reduce the risk of damages and enhance the overall safety of their operations. Prioritize pre-flight checks, environmental awareness, and emergency preparedness to ensure a positive and incident-free drone flying experience.
