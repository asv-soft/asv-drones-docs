### Safe Drone Operation Guidelines

#### Introduction

Safety is paramount in drone operations. Whether you are a novice or experienced drone operator, adhering to safe practices is essential to prevent accidents, ensure regulatory compliance, and protect both people and property. Asv.Drones emphasizes the following guidelines for safe drone operation:

#### 1. **Know and Follow Local Regulations:**

   - Familiarize yourself with and adhere to local drone regulations. Stay informed about airspace restrictions, flight altitudes, and any specific rules imposed by aviation authorities.

#### 2. **Pre-Flight Check:**

   - Before each flight, conduct a thorough pre-flight check. Ensure that the drone, remote controller, and any connected devices are in good working condition. Verify that GPS signal strength is adequate.

#### 3. **Weather Conditions:**

   - Avoid flying in adverse weather conditions such as strong winds, rain, or fog. Check the weather forecast before each flight and plan accordingly.

#### 4. **Maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS):**

   - Keep the drone within your visual line of sight at all times. Maintaining direct visual contact ensures you can monitor the drone's surroundings and react to potential hazards.

#### 5. **Respect Privacy:**

   - Avoid flying over private property without permission, and respect individuals' privacy. Be aware of your surroundings and the impact of drone operations on others.

#### 6. **Battery Management:**

   - Monitor the drone's battery levels regularly during flight. Plan your missions to ensure the drone returns safely before the battery is critically low.

#### 7. **Emergency Procedures:**

   - Be familiar with emergency procedures and have a plan in place for unexpected situations. This includes activating Return to Home (RTH) functions or manual control override.

#### 8. **Avoid No-Fly Zones:**

   - Stay clear of no-fly zones, such as airports, government facilities, and other restricted areas. Utilize geofencing features if available in your drone and software.

#### 9. **Responsible Flying:**

   - Fly your drone responsibly and considerately. Avoid flying over crowds, wildlife, or sensitive environments. Be mindful of the impact of drone noise on the surrounding area.

#### 10. **Education and Training:**

   - Stay informed about advancements in drone technology and continuously educate yourself on safe flying practices. Consider taking training courses to enhance your skills and knowledge.

#### 11. **Insurance Coverage:**

   - If applicable, ensure that you have appropriate insurance coverage for your drone operations. Some regions may require drone operators to have liability insurance.

#### 12. **Secure Software Updates:**

   - Keep your drone's firmware and Asv.Drones updated. Software updates often include safety improvements and bug fixes.

#### 13. **Emergency Landing Sites:**

   - Identify and be aware of suitable emergency landing sites in the vicinity. Having a plan for emergency landings can mitigate potential risks.

#### 14. **Secure Storage and Transport:**

   - When not in use, store your drone in a secure and dry location. During transport, use protective cases to prevent damage.

#### Conclusion

By following these safe drone operation guidelines, you contribute to the responsible and sustainable integration of drones into the airspace. Prioritize safety in every aspect of your drone operations to enjoy the benefits of this technology while minimizing risks.
