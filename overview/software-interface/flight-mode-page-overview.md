### Flight Mode Page

#### Overview

The Flight Mode page in Asv.Drones provides a dynamic and interactive environment for monitoring and controlling drones in real-time. Central to this page is a world map that serves as a visual representation of drone locations and connected devices.

#### World Map

- **Anchors and Devices:**
  - The world map displays anchors representing drones and other connected devices.

- **Interactive Anchors:**
  - Users can interact with anchors by clicking on them, revealing additional information, controls, and options related to the corresponding drone or device.

#### Widget Layout

The Flight Mode page is designed with dedicated spaces for different types of widgets, providing a comprehensive view of telemetry data, SDR information, and logs.

- **Left Sidebar Widgets:**
  - **Telemetry Widgets:** Display real-time telemetry data for drones and ground base stations. Information includes altitude, speed, battery level, and other relevant metrics.
  - **Anchors Editor Widget:** Appears when the user selects any anchor on the map. It allows the user to edit the anchor's location and altitude if the selected anchor is editable, and the Move Anchors toggle is active.
